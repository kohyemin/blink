# blink

This repository has three files to blink the LED on an Arduino board.

"Blink.cpp" is a library for making Blink class and defining constructor, Led_On function, and Led_Off function.
(Led_On function : turn the LED on / Led_Off function : turn the LED off)
"Blink.h" is a library for making Blink class and this includes constructor, variable, and functions(Led_On, Led_Off).
"Blink.ino" uses Blink class and makes a blink object. By using function of the Blink class, we can make the LED on our Arduino board blink!
